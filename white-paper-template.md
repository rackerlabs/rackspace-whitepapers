Write your white paper in Markdown. For Markdown help, see the
[Markdown guidelines](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
If necessary, the writing staff can convert papers written in html, MS Word, or
other tools and formats to Markdown for you.

The following sections provide the recommended format of a Rackspace technical
white paper.  We strongly recommend that you follow these guidelines in order
to create a consistent experience for our readers.  Exceptions may be made on a
case by case basis.

### Executive Summary (requires)

Provide a summary of your complete report content. At least a sentence per
section is advised: Problem Definition, Solution Details, Results, and
Conclusion.  Use this space to help the reader quickly ascertain the paper's
purpose, especially if they don’t have time to read the whole paper.  Readers
may read only the Executive summary or may skip it, so it should stand on its
own.


### Introduction (required)

Provide context and any background required to understand the paper. Explain
the project motivation, if necessary, and provide a focused, clear purpose
statement for the entire paper.

### Problem Definition (optional, but strongly encouraged)

The reader should understand the impact of your work prior to reading the
details of how you did it.  If you fully defined the problem in your
introduction, you may skip this section. Ideally, the Introduction provides a
high-level view, and the Problem Definition provides more detail.

For guidance on when to use diagrams and screenshots, see the
[Screenshot and diagram guidelines](http://rackerlabs.github.io/docs-rackspace/style-guide/screenshot-diagram-guidelines.html).

#### Solution Description and Details (required)

Describe how you solved the previously defined problem so that the reader can
replicate your work. This section could be divided into several subheadings,
each corresponding to the major steps you took to complete your work. It may
help to have a high level explanation of the process you went through prior to
detailing what you did. Provide clear examples, where appropriate, and be sure
to state any assumptions.

For guidance on when to use diagrams and screenshots, see the
[Screenshot and diagram guidelines](http://rackerlabs.github.io/docs-rackspace/style-guide/screenshot-diagram-guidelines.html).

       To display code in a block, indent code samples by four spaces in regular
       text and increase the indent as necessary in lists (as shown here).

### Results and Discussion (required)

Include qualitative and quantitative outcomes - Was the problem successfully
resolved?  What was learned?  Discuss benefits and risks of taking actions
described in the paper.

### Conclusion (required)

State future implications or avenues for further discovery. Were there
limitations on your process that, when lifted, could open the door to more
progress?  This is an opportunity to motivate the reader to be the next author
of a white paper, from which everyone can benefit. If appropriate, include a
call to action - what do you hope the reader will do after reading the paper?

### Resources (optional)

List any resources you used or which you recommend to the readers. Include any
links to related content. Use a bulleted list if you have more than one link.
For example:

- [Create an image from a server and restore a server from a saved image](/how-to/create-an-image-from-a-server-and-restore-a-server-from-a-saved-image)
- [About Cloud Server images](/how-to/about-cloud-server-images)
